  <div class="faq">
    <h3>Do you provide legal advice or legal representation?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>No.</strong> Marietta Research Solutions is not a law firm and does not provide legal advice or legal
      representation. Paralegal/document services are non-legal support only. Any legal strategy or advice must be provided
      by a licensed attorney.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h3>What types of clients do you work with?</h3>
    <p>
      We support small businesses, law firms, inventors, and individuals. Many engagements are remote, with in-person
      services available by appointment when appropriate (including notary services).
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h3>Do you work with small law firms on AI adoption?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. We help small firms adopt practical AI workflows for intake/triage, drafting assistance, internal knowledge
      organization, and process automation—always with attorney review for legal content.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h3>Do you work remotely?</h3>
    <p>

  <div class="faq">
    <h3>How quickly can you start?</h3>

      We typically respond within <strong>1–2 business days</strong> and can often begin shortly after a brief consult,
      depending on scope and scheduling.
    </p>

  <div class="faq">
    <h3>What do you need from me to get started?</h3>

  <div class="faq">
    <h3>Do you guarantee outcomes (approval, award, business results)?</h3>

      No. We provide professional support and best-effort deliverables, but outcomes can depend on third parties,
      requirements, data, and implementation.
